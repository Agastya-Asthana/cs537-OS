# cs537-OS
This contains code from all the projects I did through the OS class.
The files for this class have been uploaded months after class ended as to not run any conflict with student misconduct.


Project 2 files have been corrupted during the upload of this project due to 
kernel level code being worked on and errors during transfer.

Every other project has been verified to be intact although unfortunately no guarantee the code will run
since these projects are designed to run on the UW Madison CSL machines as they were graded on those.
