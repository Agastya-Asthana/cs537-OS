To run the tests:

There are currently 8 different test cases available in ~cs537-1/tests/P7/test_disk_images.
Each of these folders has an input and output file.

*0 example image (image-01 will not be used for the final testing)
1 empty ext2 img
2 not an ext2 img
3 multiple directories
4 non-jpg distracter files; corrupted files with jpg extension but wrong magic number
5 group size different from default and multiple groups
6 deleted files and jpgs outside top_secret
7 deleted directories

Run the following command 
cp -r ~cs537-1/tests/P7/* . 
to copy all the tests to your working directory

Then run your runscan with the provided disk images, and run rcheck to find the number of mismatches. The rcheck executable is also present in the ~cs537-1/tests/P7 folder, so once it is copied over, you can use this command to run it:
python3 rcheck.py <your output dir> <test output dir>

Make sure your program fails gracefully in all cases.
*00.img is the original imgae-01 file.
